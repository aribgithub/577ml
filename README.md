Introduction:
This repository has been  created by Arib Siddiqui, a graduate student of MEML program at Rice. It contains all projects created in my graduate level INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning course instructed by Randy Davila.  In this repository I am implementing Machine learning algorithms in data set called Taxis.csv.‚Äù


In this course, we are learning data science and machine learning algorithms and python-based applications. Course topics consist of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and optimization methods.
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is training an algorithm with predetermined labels and features. A label is the prediction we are interested in and the exact shape and meaning of a label can change from project to project. For example, the label for a computer vision project typically uses a one-hot encoding method the size of the number of objects the algorithm needs to learn while the label of a regression algorithm is a prediction made by fitting a line to data. Supervised learning covers the following topics:

Supervised learning:

Model Building and Error Analysis
Linear Regression
Gradient Descent
Logistic Regression
Neural Nets
Support Vector Machines
k-Nearest Neighbors
Decision/ Regression Trees
Ensemble Learning

Unsupervised Learning:

Unsupervised learning is used to identify patterns and relationships of unlabeled data. For example, if you have a large dataset and would like to find how many groups most accurately represent the data you would use an unsupervised learning algorithm to determine the number of clusters.  Unsupervised learning covers the following topic:

k-Means Clustering
Principle Component Analysis


Reinforcement Learning:
Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods
